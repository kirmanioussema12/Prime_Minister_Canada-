## 🧠 Methodology

### 🔢 Numerical Computation (NumPy)
All numerical calculations are performed using **NumPy arrays**, including:

- Median height (`np.median`)
- Mean age at start (`np.mean`)
- Percentiles (`np.percentile`)
- Histograms (`np.histogram`)
- Correlation (`np.corrcoef`)
- Z-scores (outlier detection)

### 🗃 Data Handling (pandas)
Used for:
- Loading CSV data
- Type conversion (dates, numerics)
- Table summaries
- Exporting enriched datasets

### 📊 Visualization (matplotlib)
Plots include:
- Age range bar charts
- Height distribution histograms (explicit bins)
- Gender distribution
- Summary KPI bar charts (median height vs average age)

## 📈 Key Analyses Included

✔ Dataset inspection (`.info()`, shape, missing values)  
✔ Median height of Prime Ministers  
✔ Average age at first term  
✔ Gender count and percentages  
✔ Age distribution using **explicit bins**  
✔ Height distribution using **explicit intervals**  
✔ Cross-analysis: gender × age range  
✔ Correlation between age and height  
✔ Export of enriched dataset for further visualization

## ✨ Author Notes

This notebook is designed to:
- Be **academically correct**
- Clearly separate **NumPy (computation)** from **pandas (structure)**
- Serve as a **data analysis learning reference** or **portfolio project**

🇨🇦 *Data inspired by public historical records*
⚠️ *Height values are estimated for analytical purposes*
